            <h1>about</h1><br>
            <p>A culture’s language is the carrier of its stories, traditions, and history. It enables elders to pass knowledge on to the new generation, gives the purest                    context to a rich history, and helps prolong the memory of past eras. When that language dies, descendants of a culture lose the thread that connects them to their              ancestors and a way of life becomes harder to express. Of the roughly 6,000 languages spoken globally today, more than 3,000 are endangered or vulnerable. </p>
            <p>Numan, meaning “yesterday” in the endangered Japanese language Ainu, is a self-teaching app interface that aims to preserve dying and endangered languages.                    Building off of artificial intelligence learning technology that was developed to teach itself games like chess, Numan learns languages as native speakers use and                talk to it. Over time, and with the native speakers' help confirming or denying proper syntax or vocabulary, Numan corrects its errors and develops enough 
             of an understanding of the language to then teach it to new speakers in a standard language-learning service model. Just as the preceeding software relied on humans              to play chess with the AI, Numan relies on conversations. In doing so, it eliminates the need for a culture's elders to teach a language themselves. All they have                to do is talk to Numan through a phone or computer screen.</p>

            <h1>features</h1><br>
            <p> Numan can be installed on any smartphone, tablet, or computer and has two distinguishing functions: to develop a language and to learn a language. Navigation                 from the home screen depends on whether the user is a native speaker who wants to help develop a language or a new learner.</p>
            <p>If the user wants to develop a language they are able to name the language and begin speaking based on prompts provided by Numan or having a casual conversation.             Once the AI feels it has enough information on the language, it is sent remotely to the database and become available to learn for anyone with the app. If the user               wants to learn a language they have the option to select one from available languages. Progress and fluency are recorded in both features to ensure the user is using             the app to its full potential.</p>

            <p> Gautam is a native speaker of Nihali, along with only 2,000 others in central India. At seventy years old, he’s watched the number of Nihali speakers slowly                 dwindle over the course of his lifetime and worries that his tribe will soon lose the ability to pass on the legacy of their history through written texts and                   documentation. While also fluent in Hindi, Gautam knows that teaching a language is outside the scope of his skills and instead searches for someone to help prolong             the life of Nihali culture. He finds Numan through his granddaughter, who shows him how to talk into her smartphone in Nihali and help the AI translate the words                 into Hindi. Every other day for the next year, Gautam spends twenty minutes having a conversation with Numan in Nihali and Hindi, confirming spelling and                         pronunciation as he goes, until the app notifies him that it has learned enough Nihali to send the language to its database and teach it to others who have the app.             Now Gautam knows that his native language is catalogued somewhere and will not die out, even if the remaining native speakers are unable to teach Nihali to new                   generations.</p>
            <p> Charlotte is a fifty year old linguistics professor who teaches a class on moribund languages at the University of Oxford. During her career, she has become                 fascinated with Amazonian dialects and learns of an endangered language called Wari, spoken by around 3,000 people in the Rondonian region of Brazil, that she is                 interested in learning and sharing with her students. Although most of the Wari people also speak Portuguese, there are very few documents to aid in learning the                 language and Charlotte thinks she’s reached a dead end. However, one of her students introduces her to Numan, which recently learned the language by conversing with             one of the native speakers in Wari and Portuguese to translate it into English. After downloading the app, Charlotte is able to learn and share an example of a                   moribund Amazonian language with her class.</p>
            <p>Daniel is a thirty year old descendant of the Kutenai people of Montana and British Columbia, and the grandson of one of twelve people who can still speak the                 native language. His grandmother is an amazing storyteller, but most of her culture’s myths are only understandable in the Kutenai language and are therefore                     inaccessible to Daniel. For years he’s been trying to convince his grandmother to teach him the language so that he can feel closer to his own family and the history             of his ancestors, but although she herself is fluent in both English and Kutenai, she doesn’t know how to teach more than a few vocabulary words. With Numan, Daniel             is able to have his grandmother speak into her laptop and have conversations with the self-teaching AI that powers the app. After six months Numan has listened to               enough Kutenai and understands the syntax and vocabulary, and is ready to teach Daniel.</p>
